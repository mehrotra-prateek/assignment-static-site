# About me

I am an accomplished IT professional with a robust track record of leading transformation programs across Development, Testing, and Infrastructure Services for one of the UK's leading asset management companies, operating in the UK, Europe, and Asia. My expertise lies in driving strategic initiatives to modernize and integrate technology platforms, with a special focus on Cloud Foundry, AWS, Cloud Automation, and Agile Continuous Delivery Automation and Management.

Throughout my career, I have leveraged deep experience in application design, development, configuration, and release automation to successfully deliver global-scale programs. My work in designing Private Cloud IaaS & PaaS solutions and integrating Public Cloud capabilities has paved the way for Cloud First strategies that optimize infrastructure efficiency and elevate service delivery. As a Global Service Owner for DevOps engineering and release automation, I have consistently driven innovation and operational excellence, managing complex environments and infrastructure, mitigating incidents, and ensuring seamless project delivery across multiple geographies.

My leadership extends to strategic project management, resource optimization, and fostering collaboration among diverse, cross-regional teams to meet functional and regulatory business needs.

On a personal note, I am an Indian national who has pursued an academic background in economics and computer science. I enjoy a fulfilling life with my wife, daughter, and our playful dog. Outside of work, I am an avid sports enthusiast and a passionate reader who values learning and growth.
